Thank you for reaching out to me regarding your concern about the unauthorized use of your company's name and logo in a phishing email. I understand that this is a serious issue and I am here to assist you in any way I can.

Firstly, I want to assure you that I have no involvement in this matter and I condemn such unethical practices. It is important to note that cybersecurity threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and it is essential for businesses to remain vigilant and take necessary measures to protect themselves from such attacks.

In light of this situation, I suggest that you take immediate action to address this issue and prevent further damage. Here are some steps you may consider taking:

1. Inform your customers and stakeholders: Alert your customers and stakeholders about the phishing email and advise them not to click on any links or provide personal information. You can do this by sending an official communication through your website, social media channels, or email.
2. Report the incident to relevant authorities: Please report the incident to the relevant authorities, such as the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) or the Police. They will be able to assist you in investigating the matter and bringing the perpetrators to justice.
3. Conduct an internal investigation: Carry out an internal investigation to determine how this incident occurred and identify any vulnerabilities in your system. This will help you strengthen your security protocols and prevent similar incidents in the future.
4. Take legal action: Consider taking legal action against the individuals responsible for the phishing email. This will serve as a deterrent to others who may attempt to engage in similar activities.
5. Enhance your cybersecurity measures: Review your cybersecurity measures and implement additional safeguards to protect your systems and data. This may include employee training programs, regular security audits, and investing in advanced security solutions.

I hope these suggestions are helpful in addressing the situation. If there is anything else I can assist you with, please feel free to reach out to me.

Best regards,
