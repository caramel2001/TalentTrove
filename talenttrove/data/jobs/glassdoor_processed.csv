Lasso is an AI-powered agent designed to manage and resolve issues in production environments autonomously. It uses an LLM based reasoning engine to react to, interpret, and implement solutions to production issues, even those it's encountering for the first time.</p><p>
Technology companies are grappling with the complexity of production environments, distracting engineers from their core task of software development. Engineers are drowning in a sea of observability data, but still require manual intervention to solve problems.</p><p>
We envision a future where engineers can concentrate on software development while Lasso takes care of the production environment. Our mission is to develop autonomous software that can manage, repair, and optimize itself&mdash;the holy grail.</p><p>
Now is a magical time to join. We're a small group of veterans in AI, software, and infrastructure, backed by a leading AI venture capital firm and Silicon Valley angels.</p><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b><br>
About the role</b></h3><p>
We&rsquo;re hiring our first Founding Software Engineer. It&rsquo;s probably our most critical hire. You will help to design and develop the core components of our product.

You&rsquo;re obsessed with the customer.</p></li><li><p>
You have strong software engineering fundamentals. You have opinions on how software is developed.</p></li><li><p>
You&rsquo;ve operated infrastructure at scale. You&rsquo;ve seen it done right, and you&rsquo;ve seen it gone wrong. Kubernetes, Kafka, Spark, microservices, and all the usual suspects.</p></li><li><p>
You love building with generative AI and have had some prior ML/AI experience.</p></li><li><p>
You have experience in Rust, C++, or Scala. Our stack is Python, TypeScript, and Go right now, but some experience in high-performance languages are important.</p></li></ul><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Examples of what you&rsquo;ll do</b></h3><ul><li><p>
The founding engineer will work closely with the CEO, CTO, and our product team to develop the core product offering and help build out the team. You&rsquo;ll work on the LLM-based reasoning engine, memory module, evaluation stack, simulation environment, and a lot more.</p></li><li><p>
Help us iterate towards product-market fit in an early stage, open ended environment.</p></li><li><p>
Embody our end users (engineers with operational responsibilities), immersing yourself in their needs, pains, and aspirations.</p></li></ul><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
How we work:</b></h3><ul><li><p>
Less is more: Small teams deliver impactful outcomes. Our focus is on meaningful work rather than long hours.</p></li><li><p>
Culture is critical: We value excitement and chemistry. We only bring in the right people who align with our vision.</p></li><li><p>
Transparent compensation: We&rsquo;ll give you levers to adjust your compensation. $120k-$180k base, and 0.5-1.5% equity. 401k matching. Great healthcare.</p></li><li><p>
We&rsquo;re in-person: We move faster when we work from the same room. We have offices in Singapore and San Francisco. We&rsquo;re flexible, but prefer in-person.</p></li><li><p>
An AI-first approach: We don't simply build AI products; we augment ourselves with it.</p></li></ul><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Interview process:</b></h3><p>
The whole process takes less than one day</p><ul><li><p>
Screen: A quick call with one of the founders.</p></li><li><p>

About Padlet</b></p><ul><li><p><b>
Vision: </b>Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet.
</p></li><li><p><b>Product</b>: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product.</p></li><li><p><b>
Impact</b>: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet.</p></li><li><p><b>
Money</b>: We are venture backed AND profitable. We are built to last one hundred years.</p></li><li><p><b>
Badassery</b>: We are 36 people (plus a baby crane that we've adopted but it doesn't really do much). That's over a million active users per employee. Some badass people work here.</p></li></ul><p><b>
Tech stack</b></p><ul><li><p><b>

We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow.</p></li><li><p>
A lot of people use Padlet. We have to solve interesting scale and concurrency problems.</p></li><li><p>
Our users are in over 200 countries, using all kinds of devices and connections, and speaking over 40 languages. We have to solve interesting internationalization problems.</p></li><li><p>
We like to craft delightful user experiences. They&rsquo;re satisfying to build.</p></li><li><p>

We ship often.</p></li><li><p>
We value beautiful code.</p></li></ul><p><b>
Sorrows of engineering at Padlet</b></p><ul><li><p>
We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We&rsquo;re working on it!</p></li><li><p>
Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We&rsquo;re working on it!</p></li></ul><p><b>

Linh Nguyen</b>: At any given point, no one really knows where Linh is. We learn of his existence through pull requests and code reviews. Frontend maestro.</p></li><li><p><b>
Brian Koh</b>: Only human we know who has impulsive urges to exercise. When he does, he doesn't care about outfits. We've seen him running in boots, tight jeans, and leather jackets. Exceptional engineer and even better mentor.</p></li></ul><p><b>

Improving how we work. E.g. improving our internationalization pipelines we use to translate our app into 40+ languages.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Qualifications</b></p><ul><li>

About Padlet</b></p><ul><li><b>
Vision: </b>Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet.
</li><li><b>Product</b>: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product.</li><li><b>
Impact</b>: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet.</li><li><b>
Money</b>: We are venture backed AND profitable. We are built to last one hundred years.</li><li><b>
Badassery</b>: We are 36 people (plus a baby crane that we've adopted but it doesn't really do much). That's over a million active users per employee. Some badass people work here.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Tech stack</b></p><ul><li><b>
Mobile apps</b>: React Native (with Swift and Java where necessary.)</li><li><b>

Web</b>: VueJS, Tailwind.</li><li><b>
Storage</b>: Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, Firestore, and Snowflake.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Joys of engineering at Padlet</b></p><ul><li>
We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow.</li><li>
A lot of people use Padlet. We have to solve interesting concurrency problems.
</li><li>Our users are in over 200 countries, using all kinds of devices and connections, and speaking over 40 languages. We have to solve interesting internationalization problems.</li><li>
We process a lot of data real fast. We have to solve interesting scale problems.</li><li>
We try to solve problems creatively instead of just throwing money at them. We are engineers! We thrive in constraints, not in the absence of them.</li><li>
We ship often.</li><li>
We value beautiful code.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Sorrows of engineering at Padlet</b></p><ul><li>
We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We&rsquo;re working on it!</li><li>
Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We&rsquo;re working on it!</li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Some people you'd be working with</b></p><ul><li><b>
Linh Nguyen</b>: At any given point, no one really knows where Linh is. We learn of his existence through pull requests and code reviews. Frontend maestro.</li><li><b>
Brian Koh</b>: Only human we know who has impulsive urges to exercise. When he does, he doesn't care about outfits. We've seen him running in boots, tight jeans, and leather jackets. Exceptional engineer and even better mentor.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Benefits</b></p><ul><li>
Top tier medical insurance for you and your family.</li><li>
Good stock options.</li><li>

What Makes Cloudflare Special?</b></p>
<p>
We're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.</p>
<p><b>
Project Galileo</b>: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers-at no cost.</p>
<p><b>
Athenian Project</b>: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.</p>
<p><b>
Path Forward Partnership</b>: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.</p>
<p><b>
1.1.1.1</b>: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.</p>

If you love working with other engineers, interacting with customers, solving real-world software mysteries and like the opportunity to tackle tough technology problems, this is your role!</p>
<p>
The Support team provides expertise to our customers: seasoned software engineers working on critical IIoT systems who face complex technical real-world problems. You will be challenged and learn a wide range of technologies: DDS, various programming languages, networking, (real-time) operating systems, databases, debugging techniques, and communication skills.</p>

Skills &amp; Experience:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Degree in Computer science or related field. Studies related to distributed systems, peer-to-peer networks, operating systems, computer networking, robotics preferred.</li>

We are looking for Senior Software Engineers to write and architect beautiful new products in Elixir that improve the quality of life of a billion people.</p><p></p><p><b>
Qualifications</b></p><ul><li>
You've written and architected Elixir applications that require scalability, performance, and security.</li><li>
At some point in your life someone has told you &mdash; <i>&quot;you write good code&quot;</i>.</li><li>
You know how to copy-paste code from Stack Overflow.</li><li>
Bonus: you have a good sense of humor.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>
About Padlet</b></p><ul><li><b>
Vision: </b>Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet.
</li><li><b>Product</b>: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product.</li><li><b>
Impact</b>: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet.</li><li><b>
Money</b>: We are venture backed AND profitable. We are built to last one hundred years.</li><li><b>
Badassery</b>: We are 36 people (plus a baby crane that we've adopted but it doesn't really do much). That's over a million active users per employee. Some badass people work here.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Joys of engineering at Padlet</b></p><ul><li>
We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow.</li><li>
A lot of people use Padlet. We have to solve interesting concurrency problems.
</li><li>Our users are in over 200 countries, using all kinds of devices and connections, and speaking over 40 languages. We have to solve interesting internationalization problems.</li><li>
We process a lot of data real fast. We have to solve interesting scale problems.</li><li>
We try to solve problems creatively instead of just throwing money at them. We are engineers! We thrive in constraints, not in the absence of them.</li><li>
We ship often.</li><li>
We value beautiful code.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Sorrows of engineering at Padlet</b></p><ul><li>
We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We&rsquo;re working on it!</li><li>
Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We&rsquo;re working on it!</li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Some people you'd work with</b></p><ul><li><b>
Linh Nguyen</b>: At any given point, no one really knows where Linh is. We learn of his existence through pull requests and code reviews. Frontend maestro.</li><li><b>
Brian Koh</b>: Only human we know who has impulsive urges to exercise. When he does, he doesn't care about outfits. We've seen him running in boots, tight jeans, and leather jackets. Exceptional engineer and even better mentor.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Benefits</b></p><ul><li>
Top tier medical, insurance for you and your family.</li><li>
Good stock options.</li><li>
Catered lunches and dinners.</li><li>
20 vacation days. Plus sickness and bereavement days for when life happens.</li><li>
All the gadgetry you need, including a new phone every year.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Special time to join</b></p><p>
Because we're small, there's a lot of energy. And because we have tremendous traction, your first commit touches tens of millions of people.

<div><p>As a parallel importer in Singapore, we import cars and other vehicles directly from the country they&rsquo;re from. After all, when you think about it, a parallel importer is nothing more than a reseller, similar to the authorised dealers like Kah Motor or Borneo Motors. We bring in the vehicles from the same source, whether it is from a factory in Japan, Korea, or Europe.</p><p>
That being said, there are smaller parallel importer companies in Singapore that buy their cars from other bigger companies. Making them a reseller of a reseller. This is usually because they lack the capital to order the vehicles directly themselves. Because for certain countries, when it comes to parallel import cars, there is a requirement on the car dealer&rsquo;s part to commit to a bulk order, imposing a greater financial strain on the smaller dealers.</p><p>
The issue? These companies may choose to take extreme actions or riskier choices just to close the sale.</p><p>
At Vins Automotive Group (VAuG), we focus on providing you with a long term solution as our goal is to grow with our clients. And it is to this extent that we continue to provide our clients with a wide range of automotive solutions, effectively making us a one-stop solution provider for all your car needs.</p>

<div><p>As a parallel importer in Singapore, we import cars and other vehicles directly from the country they&rsquo;re from. After all, when you think about it, a parallel importer is nothing more than a reseller, similar to the authorised dealers like Kah Motor or Borneo Motors. We bring in the vehicles from the same source, whether it is from a factory in Japan, Korea, or Europe.</p><p>
That being said, there are smaller parallel importer companies in Singapore that buy their cars from other bigger companies. Making them a reseller of a reseller. This is usually because they lack the capital to order the vehicles directly themselves. Because for certain countries, when it comes to parallel import cars, there is a requirement on the car dealer&rsquo;s part to commit to a bulk order, imposing a greater financial strain on the smaller dealers.</p><p>
The issue? These companies may choose to take extreme actions or riskier choices just to close the sale.</p><p>
