Disclosures
COMMITMENT TO THE UK STEWARDSHIP CODE - Under Rule 2.2.3R of the Financial Conduct Authority's (“FCA”) Conduct of Business Sourcebook, Squarepoint Capital LLP (“Squarepoint UK LLP” or “the Firm”), to the extent it is managing investments for a professional client (as defined by the FCA), is required to include a disclosure about the nature of its commitment to the UK Financial Reporting Council's Stewardship Code (the ""Code"") or, where it does not commit to the Code, explain its considered choice based on the Firm’s investment approach.  The Code is a voluntary code and sets out a number of principles relating to engagement by investors in UK-listed companies.  Squarepoint UK LLP invests in a broad range of asset classes on a predominantly systematic basis in a variety of jurisdictions globally and exposure to UK-listed issuers is, as a result, likely to be relatively limited in terms of overall exposure at any given point.  Therefore, whilst Squarepoint UK LLP generally supports the objectives that underlie the Code, the nature of its investment strategy would mean that it is not practical for it to formally engage with investee companies on a voluntary basis in any particular jurisdiction through the exercise of its voting rights. The Firm has therefore chosen not to commit to the Code at this time.Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD II)SRD II aims to promote effective stewardship and long term investment decision making. It sets requirements in several areas, including transparency of engagement policies and investment strategies across the institutional investment community.Under Rule 2.2B.5R of the Financial Conduct Authority's (“FCA”) Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and with respect to investment activity in shares admitted to trading on regulated markets in the EEA, or on comparable regulated markets outside the EEA, Squarepoint Capital LLP “Squarepoint UK LLP” or “the Firm”) is required to either 1.       develop and publicly disclose an “Engagement Policy” providing details of how the Firms investment strategies and shareholder engagement activities, and their implementation, contribute towards the medium and long term performance of the assets of the fund; or2.       publicly disclose a clear and reasoned explanation of why it has chosen not to comply with any of the requirements under this ruleAs Squarepoint UK LLP has a quantitative and systematic trading approach, the nature of its investment strategy would mean that it is not practical for it to formally engage with investee companies and carry out shareholder engagement activities. The Firm has therefore chosen not to implement an Engagement Policy at this time.

Copied!About the Programme
Our goal is to give you a real sense of what it’s like to work at Jane Street full-time. Over the course of your internship, you will explore ways to approach and solve exciting problems within your field of interest through fun and challenging classes, interactive sessions and group discussions—and then you will have the chance to put those lessons to practical use.
As an intern, you are paired with full-time employees who act as mentors, collaborating with you on real-world projects we actually need done. When you’re not working on your project, you will have plenty of time to use our office amenities, physical and virtual educational resources, attend guest speakers and social events and engage with the parts of our work that excite you the most.
If you’ve never thought about a career in finance, you’re in good company. Many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind, a collaborative spirit and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you’ll fit right in.
About the Position
As a Windows Engineering intern, you’ll work side by side with full-timers in the IT department to learn how we design, deploy, secure and maintain key infrastructure components that are critical to Jane Street's success. Our Windows Engineers manage a combination of systems we’ve created ourselves, open-source tools meshed together to provide higher-level functions, and integrations with industry-leading third-party tools and platforms. All of these systems serve to support the Windows desktop and server estate, as well as the tech infrastructure across the company, regardless of platform.
On any given day, you may be troubleshooting technical issues, brainstorming approaches to improve systems and workflows, writing code or learning about new technology our team may want to deploy. You’ll also learn how we use OCaml (our primary development language), F# (a similar language used with our Windows systems) and PowerShell (a scripting language used for the majority of our automation in IT) in our day-to-day work, and gain exposure to the libraries and tools that are foundational to our internal systems.
During the internship, you’ll be exposed to technologies ranging from directory services, DNS implementations and software deployment tools, to enterprise telephony infrastructure, remoting protocols and hardware/virtualisation platforms.
After your initial training, you’ll work in tandem with full-timers on two projects. You’ll also have an opportunity to work on some more general engineering tasks. While your projects may vary in scope and content, they are drawn directly from our team’s mission-critical stack and could include things like:

Developing and maintaining tools and applications related to user and group administration, hardware/software inventory, operating system builds and software development environments
Identifying, researching and remediating tech vulnerabilities and improving related tooling
Automating repetitive tasks ranging from user onboarding to performing security assessments on new software
Standardising our Windows, telephony and virtualisation environments by optimising code and monitoring tools (infrastructure as code)
Performing wide-scale configuration changes

About You
We don’t expect you to have a background in one specific field. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you currently know. We’re looking for smart people who enjoy solving problems and are:

A strong programmer who can demonstrate high potential and an aptitude for learning
Knowledgeable of operating system fundamentals and computer architecture
Able to understand network protocols at a basic level
Intellectually curious, collaborative and eager to learn
Humble, unafraid to ask questions, and is able to admit their mistakes
A strong communicator
As comfortable at the command line as you are in a GUI 
Experience with Windows Operating systems—whether that’s from coursework, time spent as a systems administrator for your campus computer lab, side projects or something else
Fluent in EnglishJane Street is an Equal Opportunity Employer

Our IT Operations Engineer Industrial Placement programme combines hands-on mentorship with a strong educational curriculum to give you a real sense of what it’s like to work at Jane Street full time. 
Over the course of your placement, you will explore ways to approach and solve exciting problems within your field of interest through fun and challenging classes, interactive sessions and group discussions—and then you will have the chance to put those lessons to practical use.
You will be paired with full-time employees who act as mentors, collaborating with you on real-world projects we actually need done.

About the Position
We are hiring for our IT Operations Engineer Industrial Placement, beginning in September 2024, with a flexible duration of 6-12 months, in our London office. If you are imagining a daily routine of making copies and watching as someone turns a computer off and back on, think again—this is not your typical IT placement. 
We will train you as if you’re joining our full-time team of IT Operations Engineers who are responsible for the support, configuration and operation of multiple systems across all of our technology stacks, including desktop engineering, network and various application platforms. 
You will help in a hands-on capacity as we make improvements to our office environment. This can include: responding to technology support requests, building and configuring Windows and Linux devices, supporting our Windows domain infrastructure, monitoring and supporting systems and helping with projects to optimise the way we work using tools like PowerShell.
Our IT placements are friendly and collaborative problem-solvers who enjoy helping people. They are able to troubleshoot in real time and listen patiently to the end user, and are comfortable asking questions and admitting to mistakes. Our placements provide a great introduction to Jane Street and how we think about and solve problems across all teams. Often, successful placements have been invited to return for a full-time position after graduation.
About You
We don’t expect you to have a background in finance or any other specific field—we’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you currently know. You should be:

Graduating in 2026
Available to work 40 hours per week in person in our London office (approx. hours are 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday - Friday)
Interested in learning about networking, programming or system administration
Eager to help people and solve problems; able to communicate clearly and respectfully
A reliable team player with a “no job too small” attitude
Comfortable working in a fast-paced environment
Humble and unafraid to ask questions and admit mistakes
Able to deconstruct technical problems, and willing to take a hands-on approach to gain experience in diagnosing, troubleshooting and resolving technical issues at the desktop, server and network levels
Able to develop and maintain technical documentation
Fluency in English required

The following skills are a plus, but certainly not required as the role includes on-the-job technical training:

Familiarity with a scripting language, such as PowerShell or Bash
Knowledge of computer hardware components and how they interact with each other
Familiarity with the Windows operating system and productivity tools such as Microsoft Excel and WordJane Street is an Equal Opportunity Employer

Over the course of your internship, you will explore ways to approach and solve exciting problems within your field of interest through fun and challenging classes, interactive sessions, and group discussions—and then you will have the chance to put those lessons to practical use.
As an intern, you are paired with full-time employees who act as mentors, collaborating with you on real-world projects we actually need done. When you’re not working on your project, you will have plenty of time to use our office amenities, physical and virtual educational resources, attend guest speakers and social events, and engage with the parts of our work that excite you the most.
If you’ve never thought about a career in finance, you’re in good company. Many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind, a collaborative spirit, and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you’ll fit right in.
About the Position
We are hiring Summer 2024 IT Operations Engineer Interns for our New York office. If you are imagining a daily routine that involves making copies and watching as someone turns a computer off and back on, think again: this is not your typical IT internship. 
We will train you as if you’re joining our full-time team of IT Operations Engineers who are responsible for the support, configuration, and operation of multiple systems across all of our technology stacks, including desktop engineering, network, and various application platforms. 
You will help in a hands-on capacity as we make improvements to our office environment. This can include: responding to technology support requests, building and configuring Windows and Linux devices, supporting our Windows domain infrastructure, monitoring and supporting systems, and helping with projects to optimize the way we work using tools like PowerShell.
Our IT interns are friendly and collaborative problem-solvers who enjoy helping people. They are able to troubleshoot in real time and listen patiently to the end user, and are comfortable asking questions and admitting to mistakes. Our internships provide a great introduction to Jane Street and how we think about and solve problems across all teams. Often, successful interns have been invited to return for a full-time position after graduation.
About You
We don’t expect you to have a background in finance or any other specific field—we’re looking for smart people who enjoy solving interesting problems. We’re actually more interested in how you think and learn than what you currently know. You should be:

Graduating in 2025
Available to work 40 hours per week in person in our NYC office (approx. hours are 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. ET Monday - Friday)
Interested in learning about networking, scripting, or system administration
Eager to help people and solve problems; able to communicate clearly and respectfully
A reliable team player with a “no job too small” attitude
Comfortable working in a fast-paced environment
Humble and unafraid to ask questions and admit mistakes
Able to analyze and deconstruct technical problems
Able to develop and maintain technical documentation
Knowledgeable in computer hardware components and how they interact with each other
Willing to take a hands-on approach to gain experience in diagnosing, troubleshooting, and resolving technical issues at the desktop, server, and network levels
Familiar with a scripting language, such as PowerShell or Bash (ideal but not required)
Fluency in English required

Base salary is $100,000.
