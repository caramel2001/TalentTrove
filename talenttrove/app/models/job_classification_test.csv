"Subject: What’s next for crypto? . Body: Coinbase BytesThe themes market watchers are paying attention to.View in browser 11/29/23 Bitcoin has seen six consecutive weeks of gains, its longest win streak since the end of 2020. [Kanchanara via Unsplash] What’s up? It’s Coinbase Bytes There’s never a dull moment on the blockchain. Here’s what you need to know this week: * The next chapter for crypto. In the wake of Binance’s settlement, here’s what might be on the horizon for the crypto industry. * How Wall Street is boosting BTC. Institutional investors have led bitcoin gains for six consecutive weeks. * This week in numbers. Solana’s eye-popping Mad Lads NFT sales, how many South Korean citizens will test the country’s CBDC, and more. Bitcoin $37,813.26 +0.95% Ethereum $2,030.91 -1.68% XRP $0.61 -0.81% Solana $59.28 +2.14% Cardano $0.38 +0.70% Dogecoin $0.08 +6.17% Bitcoin $37,813.26 +0.95% Ethereum $2,030.91 -1.68% XRP $0.61 -0.81% Solana $59.28 +2.14% Cardano $0.38 +0.70% Dogecoin $0.08 +6.17% Price changes are for the past week, ending on Nov 29, 2023 at 10:36 PM UTC See the latest prices MARKET UPDATE After Binance’s settlement, what’s next for crypto? Following the news last week of Binance’s settlement with U.S. authorities, crypto markets responded with far more optimism than one might have suspected. Prices spiked in the days following the announcement — with BTCclimbing above $38,000 for the first time since 2022. As Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong put it in an interview with CNBC on Monday, “The enforcement action against Binance, that’s allowing us to turn the page on that and hopefully close that chapter of crypto’s history.” So what’s next for crypto as a new chapter opens? Here’s what analysts and market watchers are predicting. Odds that a spot crypto ETF will gain approval may have improved. As Armstrong told CNBC, “I think that regulatory clarity is going to help bring in more investment, especially from institutions.” As CoinDesk reports, some industry watchers say that the enforcement action “may have cleared the decks for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to finally approve a spot bitcoin ETF … by [easing] the agency's concerns regarding overseas manipulation of bitcoin prices.” (More on the current importance of institutional crypto investment in the second story in today’s newsletter.) For much of this year, the prospect of Wall Street getting into spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has been a major catalyst for crypto prices. At leasteight spot BTC ETF proposals — which would buy bitcoin and sell shares via conventional brokerages — are currently in front of the SEC. The need for regulatory clarity is on everyone’s mind. Among the spot crypto ETF applicants are some of the world’s largest financial firms — household names like Fidelity and BlackRock. A Moody’s crypto analyst compared this moment to the transition from the relative wild west of the early internet era to the more clearly regulated current landscape,noting that the Binance settlement “marks the same inflection point that we saw earlier at the intersection of the dot-com and post-dot-com eras.” Coinbase has long argued that a lack of clear regulations in the U.S. has dampened crypto innovation here. Meanwhile, places such as theUnited Kingdom andDubai and regions like theEuropean Union have forged ahead with regulatory regimes that offer more guidance to firms and traders. Emerging crypto trends are picking up steam as major corporations invest. Crypto analyst Jamie Coutts recently gathered together many of the trends that could power the next wave of crypto adoption. Among them are stories Bytes has covered this year, including: * Tokenization of real-world assets . According to a Bernstein report, tokenization represents a $5 trillion opportunity in the next five years — in which stocks, real estate, artwork, and more can be represented on a blockchain. Dozens of the world’s largest financial institutions have conducted experiments in tokenization. This week, U.K. regulatorsbegan exploring a framework to allow asset managers to use tokenization with common asset classes. * Top gaming companies incorporating NFTs . On Monday, Final Fantasy publisher Square Enixbegan to launch “Symbiogenesis” — its first Ethereum-powered game — with an auction of NFT-based characters. Meanwhile, the most anticipated of the new wave of web3 games is probably the first-person shooter “Shrapnel,” which is scheduled for an early preview this year before fully rolling out in 2024. Itreportedly looks and plays like a “AAA” game such as Halo — but with an NFT marketplace that allows players to buy, sell, and truly own in-game assets, and a staking system that allows them to “participate in the development and promotion of unique maps.” The bottom line… The periodic down cycles known as “crypto winter” are when strong companies innovate and help build the foundation for the next bull run. “Bear markets wash out many of the bad businesses, business practices, inefficiencies and bad actors,” Jeff Embry, managing partner of crypto hedge fund Globe 3 Capital,told Blockworks . “[They're] an important part of clearing the way for the next bull market cycle.” Learn about bull markets WHALE STREET How institutional traders helped BTC rise for six weeks straight For the first time since the end of 2020, bitcoin saw six consecutive weeks of gains, with prices hovering close to the $38,000 range. That’s a way bigger number than the 200-week moving average (200WMA) of about $29,000 as of November 23. What’s important about that? The 200WMA, which tracks bitcoin’s price over the last 200 weeks, is a key indicator for many investors — especially following a bear market. Historically, BTC bottoms in pricenear its 200WMA , which it did last fall after the FTX collapse. But once BTC starts settling at levels well above its 200WMA, prices typically continue to rise in the following months. (Remember: Past performance is just one clue among many and is not indicative of future results.) Crypto fund inflows just had their biggest week in two years. As anticipation for the approval of the first U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETF ramps up — and with BlackRock and Fidelity planning similar products for ETH — nearly $350 million poured into crypto investment products last week, doubling inflows from the week before,according to CoinShares . In total, crypto investment products now have around $45 billion in assets under management — the highest figure in 18 months. Notably, the amount of capital flowing into products focused on shorting BTC (or betting that prices will fall) has declined by more than 60% since April, indicating that many traders are betting that prices have more room to grow. Products focused on ETH, SOL, DOT, and LINK also saw inflows of capital. Less than 10% of the week’s new money came from U.S. traders, potentially a sign that they’re waiting for one of the new crypto ETFs to gain approval. Investors are betting that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust will soon become an exchange-traded product. One of the first firms that could receive approval for a spot BTC ETF is Grayscale, whichwon a lawsuit against the SEC earlier this year over its denial of the firm’s years-long quest to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product into a spot BTC exchange-traded product. What’s the difference between a trust and an ETF? Instead of buying BTC and selling shares via a conventional brokerage like an ETF would, GBTCtracks the price of BTC — giving investors indirect exposure to bitcoin. Another key difference: ETFs can issue new shares to keep the share price in balance with the value of the assets held by the ETF. GBTC, on the other hand, fluctuates — trading at a premium to the price of bitcoin during periods of high demand and a discount at periods of lower demand. This year, GBTC’s discount has narrowed from as much as 50% toaround 8% as $2.5 billion has flowed into the trust — with someanalysts predicting that GBTC will become an ETF in the near future, at which point their currently discounted shares would rise to the market value of BTC. The bottom line… Markets are showing many signs that they’re optimistic about prices continuing to go up — including the growing conviction that a spot BTC ETF will gain SEC approval in the near future. (Bloomberg Intelligencepredicts it will happen in January .) But that’s not the only major potential bull market spark on the horizon. Many analysts point to spring of 2024’s halving event — in which the amount of new BTC generated by mining is reduced by 50% — asthe next big potential boost . Learn about halvings NUMBERS TO KNOW $650 million Value of altcoins set to be “unlocked ” this week across projects including DYDX, Optimism, SUI, Hedera, 1inch, and Immutable X. Token unlocks are a crypto version of vesting that involve scheduled releases of crypto to early buyers or contributors to a project. Bigger unlocks may temporarily result in supply outstripping demand, driving prices down. $1.39 million Dollar value of the Solana-based Mad Lads NFTs that sold on secondary markets in a 24-hour period ending on Tuesday — making the “profile-pic collection” the biggest NFT seller in that period, easily topping Bored Ape Yacht Club's $881,000 in sales. 100,000 Approximate number of South Korean citizens who will participate in a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot next year.

"Subject: M&A Goes Out with a Bang. Body: November 30, 2023 Read in Browser https://thedailyupside.cmail19.com/t/t-e-vdrltdy-jjlusjdiy-ji/ TOGETHER WITH Good morning. Well, they did say it was all-you-can-eat. In America, diners take that as a dare. Red Lobster said its $20 “Ultimate Endless Shrimp” deal is partly to blame for its $11 million loss in its most recent third quarter. On the low end, a pound of shrimp runs about $5 or $6, so all those free portions can really add up. It’s like Bubba says: Shrimp is the fruit of the sea. Red Lobster plans to raise the price of shrimp endlessness to $25 as it sits on the verge of a $20 million loss for 2023. Earlier this year, parent company Thai Union Group hinted that it might drop Red Lobster entirely if losses continued to mount. The restaurant chain might have to start fishing for a new backer. What’s Bubba up to, anyway? Morning Brief • GM wants to make it up to investors. • An AI superstar heads for unstable times. • The year’s biggest deal is in the works. Please do not delete this text. Please do not delete this text. Autos GM Sets Out to Soothe Shareholders with Spending Cuts, Dividend Boost (Photo by Brad Killen via Unsplash) General Motors is getting a head start on its 2024 New Year’s resolution — make the shareholders happy again. America’s largest auto manufacturer is trying to regain Wall Street’s favor with buybacks, spending cuts on less promising projects, and more. GM hopes its plan outlasts most resolutions, which dissolve long before the calendar turns to February. Strike Out One of GM’s biggest obstacles in 2023 hit much of the industry: The recent United Auto Workers strike — which saw 40,000 employees of GM, Stellantis, and Ford walk off the job for a month and a half — cost GM roughly $800 million, which is equivalent to nearly 10% of its profit for all of 2022. To end the strike, GM tentatively agreed to raise its wages by 25% and place joint-venture battery plants under its main contract with the union. On top of that, GM, like many car companies [https://www.thedailyupside.com/industries/autos/toyotas-hybrids-are-having-a-moment/], has been experiencing “evolving demand,” i.e. poor sales, for electric vehicles. Most car manufacturers have set out to go all-electric by 2035, but adoption rates aren’t cooperating. The average $50,000-plus price tag for an EV just isn’t in the budget for anyone who wasn’t an early adopter. All of that has contributed to GM’s stock slumping 14% so far this year. But lo, a plan to return “significant capital” to shareholders has, for the moment, won hearts and minds: • GM announced Wednesday that it will boost its quarterly dividend by one-third, initiate a $10 billion buyback, and also reinstate its full-year earnings guidance that it had pulled when the strike started. And despite the new union contracts, CEO Mary Barra said, “We are finalizing a 2024 budget that will fully offset the incremental costs of our new labor agreements.” GM’s stock shot up 9% on the news. • To achieve those offsets, GM is delaying investments in EV production and taking down the goalposts altogether for near-term output. Additionally, the company intends to cut spending on Cruise, its self-driving unit. GM originally planned to test its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco and three other cities, but is scaling down its focus after a crash last month that injured a pedestrian. Down Mexico Way: While GM and Ford have solid grips on the domestic market, competition is growing south of the border. Last year, Mexico was the leading importer of Chinese cars, and so far in 2023 it trails only Russia, Bloomberg [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-28/chinese-car-brands-are-selling-leftover-gas-vehicles-to-mexico] reported. With some Chinese cars running $10,000 less than US-made equivalents, American automakers might have to readjust their pricing, or throw in a free air freshener. - Griffin Kelly Please do not delete this text.

Stability AI, the London-based startup behind popular AI-powered image-generator Stable Diffusion, is shopping itself to potential acquirers, sources told Bloomberg [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-29/stability-ai-has-explored-sale-as-investor-urges-ceo-to-resign?srnd=technology-vp]. The sources said a deal isn’t definite, but a major investor has raised red flags about the state of the company’s finances and is pressuring CEO Emad Mostaque to step down. ‘Tis the season for ousting AI CEOs, which also makes us wonder how much more unstable AI could get. Instability AI Stability has been a pretty big name in the generative AI explosion that followed ChatGPT’s public release last year — big enough for Getty to target in a copyright lawsuit filed last January. And Mostaque himself has subtly fed into the idea that the investment pouring into AI companies may be a tad exuberant, telling analysts in July [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/ai-will-be-the-biggest-bubble-of-all-time-stability-ai-ceo.html] that he believes AI will be the “biggest bubble of all time.” The company raised $101 million [https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/17/stability-ai-the-startup-behind-stable-diffusion-raises-101m/] in October last year, reportedly achieving a valuation of $1 billion. Truth to power, Mostaque. Right on. But one of the investors behind that round of funding, Coatue Management, has internally sounded the alarm about both the company’s finances and Mostaque’s leadership, sources told Bloomberg. Now the company might be exploring options to sell itself — though it’s not necessarily shopping itself to bigger tech fish: • Sources told Bloomberg that Stability has held a few early-days talks with companies that could potentially purchase the company, including two other AI tech startups, Jasper and Cohere. • A Stability spokesperson pushed back against that claim. “While several parties have expressed interest in the purchase of Stability AI, we are not trying to sell the company and are focused on releasing leading models,” the spokesperson told Bloomberg. Try Pirelli’s Miracle Algorithm: The AI gold rush has been in full swing for 12 months now, but that hasn’t actually translated into a ton of M&A activity in the sector (unless you count Microsoft briefly adopting Sam Altman before he returned to OpenAI). An October EY survey of CEOs [https://www.ey.com/en_gl/ceo/ceo-outlook-global-report] across all sectors found this is because so many AI startups are promising marvels of technology that CEOs with acquisitions on their minds have a hard time separating the legitimately cool tech from the more snake-oily variety. There’s gotta be AI that can help them with that. - Isobel Asher Hamilton Please do not delete this text. Please do not delete this text.

In a bid to scale up against larger rivals, health insurance players Cigna and Humana are in talks over a possible merger, according to a Wall Street Journal report [https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/cigna-humana-in-talks-for-blockbuster-merger-c5c7f1b0?mod=hp_lead_pos1] on Wednesday. Beefing Up Cigna and Humana are both relatively small businesses (emphasis on relatively) compared to the industry’s top two companies, United Health and CVS Health. Last year, the latter two generated revenue of just over $320 billion, while Cigna and Humana generated about $181 billion and $83 billion, respectively. But both companies have relatively narrow-scoped businesses, and, at least on paper, they’d each bring something to the table that the other sorely lacks: • Cigna would bring its massive pharmacy-benefit unit, Express Scripts, which manages prescription drug plans. It also has a strong foothold in the commercial insurance sector. • Humana, meanwhile, fills a longstanding hole at Cigna: a strong Medicare practice. Humana’s Medicare insurance unit is No. 2 in the industry, behind just UnitedHealth, while Cigna has barely cracked the sector. Antitrust Me: With Cigna’s market cap of roughly $83 billion and Humana’s market cap of $62 billion, any deal — which the companies hope to complete before the end of the year, sources told the WSJ — would mark the largest M&A transaction of 2023. It’d also likely trigger an antitrust response. In fact, to pre-empt any action from the FTC, Cigna is already exploring a sale of its existing, albeit measly, Medicare Advantage unit. Even then, health insurance has faced particularly tough scrutiny in recent years. Cigna and Humana explored a merger in 2015, but that brief dalliance died when Humana instead agreed to a deal with Aetna — which itself ended up scuttled over antitrust concerns.

The changes include a daily fee payment structure and the option for assets to be blended in an account for easy share creation and redemption. Experts are suggesting that this is yet another sign that the spot bitcoin ETF applications from Grayscale and others will be approved. ABU DHABI TOKENIZED EQUITY? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] The Abu Dhabi-based M2 Exchange has launched a token called MMX that is tied to M2 Global Wealth Limited, giving rise to speculations of a possible tokenized equity platform being approved in Abu Dhabi. There are questions about its business structure as it has entities regulated both in Abu Dhabi and the Bahamas. However, Abu Dhabi's new legislation reflects a desire to make the city into a crypto hub, and allowing for tokenized equity like this thread suggests would set the region apart. 🚀 INNOVATION & LAUNCHES SEI V2 - THE FIRST PARALLELIZED EVM BLOCKCHAIN (7 MINUTE READ) [7] Sei is planning a major upgrade to the chain, intending to create the first fully parallelized EVM. Known as Sei v2, the upgrade will allow the Sei network to maintain its rapid block finalization and transaction rate while adding support for EVM smart contracts. This means developers can implement already-audited smart contracts from EVM-compatible blockchains without changing their code. The upgrade is expected to be released on testnet in Q1 2024.

CASINO TOKENS BREAKDOWN (6 MINUTE READ) [10] This thread analyzes and compares the performances of three crypto casino tokens: $RLB, $BCB, and $KNK. The analysis is based on the volumes/revenues of each token's respective product. According to this analysis, $RLB has been the best performer, with its current market cap sitting at $500m and an approximate 20% monthly growth rate. $BCB and $KNK have shown less promising growth rates, with $KNK recently experiencing a steep decline. 🦄 MISCELLANEOUS RETHINKING THE FLATCOIN PROBLEM (5 MINUTE READ) [11] This article debates the necessity of a stablecoin for a robust monetary system, challenging the common belief that market-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could fulfill this role. The author suggests a simplified monetary system, maintaining price stability with optimal interest rates, rather than attempting to create a stablecoin pegged to purchasing power. Establishing a native unit of account with a controlled monetary policy might be more beneficial than launching yet another stablecoin effort.
