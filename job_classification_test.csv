"Subject: What’s next for crypto? . Body: Coinbase BytesThe themes market watchers are paying attention to.View in browser 11/29/23 Bitcoin has seen six consecutive weeks of gains, its longest win streak since the end of 2020. [Kanchanara via Unsplash] What’s up? It’s Coinbase Bytes There’s never a dull moment on the blockchain. Here’s what you need to know this week: * The next chapter for crypto. In the wake of Binance’s settlement, here’s what might be on the horizon for the crypto industry. * How Wall Street is boosting BTC. Institutional investors have led bitcoin gains for six consecutive weeks. * This week in numbers. Solana’s eye-popping Mad Lads NFT sales, how many South Korean citizens will test the country’s CBDC, and more. Bitcoin $37,813.26 +0.95% Ethereum $2,030.91 -1.68% XRP $0.61 -0.81% Solana $59.28 +2.14% Cardano $0.38 +0.70% Dogecoin $0.08 +6.17% Bitcoin $37,813.26 +0.95% Ethereum $2,030.91 -1.68% XRP $0.61 -0.81% Solana $59.28 +2.14% Cardano $0.38 +0.70% Dogecoin $0.08 +6.17% Price changes are for the past week, ending on Nov 29, 2023 at 10:36 PM UTC See the latest prices MARKET UPDATE After Binance’s settlement, what’s next for crypto? Following the news last week of Binance’s settlement with U.S. authorities, crypto markets responded with far more optimism than one might have suspected. Prices spiked in the days following the announcement — with BTCclimbing above $38,000 for the first time since 2022. As Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong put it in an interview with CNBC on Monday, “The enforcement action against Binance, that’s allowing us to turn the page on that and hopefully close that chapter of crypto’s history.” So what’s next for crypto as a new chapter opens? Here’s what analysts and market watchers are predicting. Odds that a spot crypto ETF will gain approval may have improved. As Armstrong told CNBC, “I think that regulatory clarity is going to help bring in more investment, especially from institutions.” As CoinDesk reports, some industry watchers say that the enforcement action “may have cleared the decks for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to finally approve a spot bitcoin ETF … by [easing] the agency's concerns regarding overseas manipulation of bitcoin prices.” (More on the current importance of institutional crypto investment in the second story in today’s newsletter.) For much of this year, the prospect of Wall Street getting into spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has been a major catalyst for crypto prices. At leasteight spot BTC ETF proposals — which would buy bitcoin and sell shares via conventional brokerages — are currently in front of the SEC. The need for regulatory clarity is on everyone’s mind. Among the spot crypto ETF applicants are some of the world’s largest financial firms — household names like Fidelity and BlackRock. A Moody’s crypto analyst compared this moment to the transition from the relative wild west of the early internet era to the more clearly regulated current landscape,noting that the Binance settlement “marks the same inflection point that we saw earlier at the intersection of the dot-com and post-dot-com eras.” Coinbase has long argued that a lack of clear regulations in the U.S. has dampened crypto innovation here. Meanwhile, places such as theUnited Kingdom andDubai and regions like theEuropean Union have forged ahead with regulatory regimes that offer more guidance to firms and traders. Emerging crypto trends are picking up steam as major corporations invest. Crypto analyst Jamie Coutts recently gathered together many of the trends that could power the next wave of crypto adoption. Among them are stories Bytes has covered this year, including: * Tokenization of real-world assets . According to a Bernstein report, tokenization represents a $5 trillion opportunity in the next five years — in which stocks, real estate, artwork, and more can be represented on a blockchain. Dozens of the world’s largest financial institutions have conducted experiments in tokenization. This week, U.K. regulatorsbegan exploring a framework to allow asset managers to use tokenization with common asset classes. * Top gaming companies incorporating NFTs . On Monday, Final Fantasy publisher Square Enixbegan to launch “Symbiogenesis” — its first Ethereum-powered game — with an auction of NFT-based characters. Meanwhile, the most anticipated of the new wave of web3 games is probably the first-person shooter “Shrapnel,” which is scheduled for an early preview this year before fully rolling out in 2024. Itreportedly looks and plays like a “AAA” game such as Halo — but with an NFT marketplace that allows players to buy, sell, and truly own in-game assets, and a staking system that allows them to “participate in the development and promotion of unique maps.” The bottom line… The periodic down cycles known as “crypto winter” are when strong companies innovate and help build the foundation for the next bull run. “Bear markets wash out many of the bad businesses, business practices, inefficiencies and bad actors,” Jeff Embry, managing partner of crypto hedge fund Globe 3 Capital,told Blockworks . “[They're] an important part of clearing the way for the next bull market cycle.” Learn about bull markets WHALE STREET How institutional traders helped BTC rise for six weeks straight For the first time since the end of 2020, bitcoin saw six consecutive weeks of gains, with prices hovering close to the $38,000 range. That’s a way bigger number than the 200-week moving average (200WMA) of about $29,000 as of November 23. What’s important about that? The 200WMA, which tracks bitcoin’s price over the last 200 weeks, is a key indicator for many investors — especially following a bear market. Historically, BTC bottoms in pricenear its 200WMA , which it did last fall after the FTX collapse. But once BTC starts settling at levels well above its 200WMA, prices typically continue to rise in the following months. (Remember: Past performance is just one clue among many and is not indicative of future results.) Crypto fund inflows just had their biggest week in two years. As anticipation for the approval of the first U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETF ramps up — and with BlackRock and Fidelity planning similar products for ETH — nearly $350 million poured into crypto investment products last week, doubling inflows from the week before,according to CoinShares . In total, crypto investment products now have around $45 billion in assets under management — the highest figure in 18 months. Notably, the amount of capital flowing into products focused on shorting BTC (or betting that prices will fall) has declined by more than 60% since April, indicating that many traders are betting that prices have more room to grow. Products focused on ETH, SOL, DOT, and LINK also saw inflows of capital. Less than 10% of the week’s new money came from U.S. traders, potentially a sign that they’re waiting for one of the new crypto ETFs to gain approval. Investors are betting that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust will soon become an exchange-traded product. One of the first firms that could receive approval for a spot BTC ETF is Grayscale, whichwon a lawsuit against the SEC earlier this year over its denial of the firm’s years-long quest to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product into a spot BTC exchange-traded product. What’s the difference between a trust and an ETF? Instead of buying BTC and selling shares via a conventional brokerage like an ETF would, GBTCtracks the price of BTC — giving investors indirect exposure to bitcoin. Another key difference: ETFs can issue new shares to keep the share price in balance with the value of the assets held by the ETF. GBTC, on the other hand, fluctuates — trading at a premium to the price of bitcoin during periods of high demand and a discount at periods of lower demand. This year, GBTC’s discount has narrowed from as much as 50% toaround 8% as $2.5 billion has flowed into the trust — with someanalysts predicting that GBTC will become an ETF in the near future, at which point their currently discounted shares would rise to the market value of BTC. The bottom line… Markets are showing many signs that they’re optimistic about prices continuing to go up — including the growing conviction that a spot BTC ETF will gain SEC approval in the near future. (Bloomberg Intelligencepredicts it will happen in January .) But that’s not the only major potential bull market spark on the horizon. Many analysts point to spring of 2024’s halving event — in which the amount of new BTC generated by mining is reduced by 50% — asthe next big potential boost . Learn about halvings NUMBERS TO KNOW $650 million Value of altcoins set to be “unlocked ” this week across projects including DYDX, Optimism, SUI, Hedera, 1inch, and Immutable X. Token unlocks are a crypto version of vesting that involve scheduled releases of crypto to early buyers or contributors to a project. Bigger unlocks may temporarily result in supply outstripping demand, driving prices down. $1.39 million Dollar value of the Solana-based Mad Lads NFTs that sold on secondary markets in a 24-hour period ending on Tuesday — making the “profile-pic collection” the biggest NFT seller in that period, easily topping Bored Ape Yacht Club's $881,000 in sales. 100,000 Approximate number of South Korean citizens who will participate in a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot next year.

"Subject: M&A Goes Out with a Bang. Body: November 30, 2023 Read in Browser https://thedailyupside.cmail19.com/t/t-e-vdrltdy-jjlusjdiy-ji/ TOGETHER WITH Good morning. Well, they did say it was all-you-can-eat. In America, diners take that as a dare. Red Lobster said its $20 “Ultimate Endless Shrimp” deal is partly to blame for its $11 million loss in its most recent third quarter. On the low end, a pound of shrimp runs about $5 or $6, so all those free portions can really add up. It’s like Bubba says: Shrimp is the fruit of the sea. Red Lobster plans to raise the price of shrimp endlessness to $25 as it sits on the verge of a $20 million loss for 2023. Earlier this year, parent company Thai Union Group hinted that it might drop Red Lobster entirely if losses continued to mount. The restaurant chain might have to start fishing for a new backer. What’s Bubba up to, anyway? Morning Brief • GM wants to make it up to investors. • An AI superstar heads for unstable times. • The year’s biggest deal is in the works. Please do not delete this text. Please do not delete this text. Autos GM Sets Out to Soothe Shareholders with Spending Cuts, Dividend Boost (Photo by Brad Killen via Unsplash) General Motors is getting a head start on its 2024 New Year’s resolution — make the shareholders happy again. America’s largest auto manufacturer is trying to regain Wall Street’s favor with buybacks, spending cuts on less promising projects, and more. GM hopes its plan outlasts most resolutions, which dissolve long before the calendar turns to February. Strike Out One of GM’s biggest obstacles in 2023 hit much of the industry: The recent United Auto Workers strike — which saw 40,000 employees of GM, Stellantis, and Ford walk off the job for a month and a half — cost GM roughly $800 million, which is equivalent to nearly 10% of its profit for all of 2022. To end the strike, GM tentatively agreed to raise its wages by 25% and place joint-venture battery plants under its main contract with the union. On top of that, GM, like many car companies [https://www.thedailyupside.com/industries/autos/toyotas-hybrids-are-having-a-moment/], has been experiencing “evolving demand,” i.e. poor sales, for electric vehicles. Most car manufacturers have set out to go all-electric by 2035, but adoption rates aren’t cooperating. The average $50,000-plus price tag for an EV just isn’t in the budget for anyone who wasn’t an early adopter. All of that has contributed to GM’s stock slumping 14% so far this year. But lo, a plan to return “significant capital” to shareholders has, for the moment, won hearts and minds: • GM announced Wednesday that it will boost its quarterly dividend by one-third, initiate a $10 billion buyback, and also reinstate its full-year earnings guidance that it had pulled when the strike started. And despite the new union contracts, CEO Mary Barra said, “We are finalizing a 2024 budget that will fully offset the incremental costs of our new labor agreements.” GM’s stock shot up 9% on the news. • To achieve those offsets, GM is delaying investments in EV production and taking down the goalposts altogether for near-term output. Additionally, the company intends to cut spending on Cruise, its self-driving unit. GM originally planned to test its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco and three other cities, but is scaling down its focus after a crash last month that injured a pedestrian. Down Mexico Way: While GM and Ford have solid grips on the domestic market, competition is growing south of the border. Last year, Mexico was the leading importer of Chinese cars, and so far in 2023 it trails only Russia, Bloomberg [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-28/chinese-car-brands-are-selling-leftover-gas-vehicles-to-mexico] reported. With some Chinese cars running $10,000 less than US-made equivalents, American automakers might have to readjust their pricing, or throw in a free air freshener. - Griffin Kelly Please do not delete this text.

Stability AI, the London-based startup behind popular AI-powered image-generator Stable Diffusion, is shopping itself to potential acquirers, sources told Bloomberg [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-29/stability-ai-has-explored-sale-as-investor-urges-ceo-to-resign?srnd=technology-vp]. The sources said a deal isn’t definite, but a major investor has raised red flags about the state of the company’s finances and is pressuring CEO Emad Mostaque to step down. ‘Tis the season for ousting AI CEOs, which also makes us wonder how much more unstable AI could get. Instability AI Stability has been a pretty big name in the generative AI explosion that followed ChatGPT’s public release last year — big enough for Getty to target in a copyright lawsuit filed last January. And Mostaque himself has subtly fed into the idea that the investment pouring into AI companies may be a tad exuberant, telling analysts in July [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/ai-will-be-the-biggest-bubble-of-all-time-stability-ai-ceo.html] that he believes AI will be the “biggest bubble of all time.” The company raised $101 million [https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/17/stability-ai-the-startup-behind-stable-diffusion-raises-101m/] in October last year, reportedly achieving a valuation of $1 billion. Truth to power, Mostaque. Right on. But one of the investors behind that round of funding, Coatue Management, has internally sounded the alarm about both the company’s finances and Mostaque’s leadership, sources told Bloomberg. Now the company might be exploring options to sell itself — though it’s not necessarily shopping itself to bigger tech fish: • Sources told Bloomberg that Stability has held a few early-days talks with companies that could potentially purchase the company, including two other AI tech startups, Jasper and Cohere. • A Stability spokesperson pushed back against that claim. “While several parties have expressed interest in the purchase of Stability AI, we are not trying to sell the company and are focused on releasing leading models,” the spokesperson told Bloomberg. Try Pirelli’s Miracle Algorithm: The AI gold rush has been in full swing for 12 months now, but that hasn’t actually translated into a ton of M&A activity in the sector (unless you count Microsoft briefly adopting Sam Altman before he returned to OpenAI). An October EY survey of CEOs [https://www.ey.com/en_gl/ceo/ceo-outlook-global-report] across all sectors found this is because so many AI startups are promising marvels of technology that CEOs with acquisitions on their minds have a hard time separating the legitimately cool tech from the more snake-oily variety. There’s gotta be AI that can help them with that. - Isobel Asher Hamilton Please do not delete this text. Please do not delete this text.

In a bid to scale up against larger rivals, health insurance players Cigna and Humana are in talks over a possible merger, according to a Wall Street Journal report [https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/cigna-humana-in-talks-for-blockbuster-merger-c5c7f1b0?mod=hp_lead_pos1] on Wednesday. Beefing Up Cigna and Humana are both relatively small businesses (emphasis on relatively) compared to the industry’s top two companies, United Health and CVS Health. Last year, the latter two generated revenue of just over $320 billion, while Cigna and Humana generated about $181 billion and $83 billion, respectively. But both companies have relatively narrow-scoped businesses, and, at least on paper, they’d each bring something to the table that the other sorely lacks: • Cigna would bring its massive pharmacy-benefit unit, Express Scripts, which manages prescription drug plans. It also has a strong foothold in the commercial insurance sector. • Humana, meanwhile, fills a longstanding hole at Cigna: a strong Medicare practice. Humana’s Medicare insurance unit is No. 2 in the industry, behind just UnitedHealth, while Cigna has barely cracked the sector. Antitrust Me: With Cigna’s market cap of roughly $83 billion and Humana’s market cap of $62 billion, any deal — which the companies hope to complete before the end of the year, sources told the WSJ — would mark the largest M&A transaction of 2023. It’d also likely trigger an antitrust response. In fact, to pre-empt any action from the FTC, Cigna is already exploring a sale of its existing, albeit measly, Medicare Advantage unit. Even then, health insurance has faced particularly tough scrutiny in recent years. Cigna and Humana explored a merger in 2015, but that brief dalliance died when Humana instead agreed to a deal with Aetna — which itself ended up scuttled over antitrust concerns.

The changes include a daily fee payment structure and the option for assets to be blended in an account for easy share creation and redemption. Experts are suggesting that this is yet another sign that the spot bitcoin ETF applications from Grayscale and others will be approved. ABU DHABI TOKENIZED EQUITY? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] The Abu Dhabi-based M2 Exchange has launched a token called MMX that is tied to M2 Global Wealth Limited, giving rise to speculations of a possible tokenized equity platform being approved in Abu Dhabi. There are questions about its business structure as it has entities regulated both in Abu Dhabi and the Bahamas. However, Abu Dhabi's new legislation reflects a desire to make the city into a crypto hub, and allowing for tokenized equity like this thread suggests would set the region apart. 🚀 INNOVATION & LAUNCHES SEI V2 - THE FIRST PARALLELIZED EVM BLOCKCHAIN (7 MINUTE READ) [7] Sei is planning a major upgrade to the chain, intending to create the first fully parallelized EVM. Known as Sei v2, the upgrade will allow the Sei network to maintain its rapid block finalization and transaction rate while adding support for EVM smart contracts. This means developers can implement already-audited smart contracts from EVM-compatible blockchains without changing their code. The upgrade is expected to be released on testnet in Q1 2024.

CASINO TOKENS BREAKDOWN (6 MINUTE READ) [10] This thread analyzes and compares the performances of three crypto casino tokens: $RLB, $BCB, and $KNK. The analysis is based on the volumes/revenues of each token's respective product. According to this analysis, $RLB has been the best performer, with its current market cap sitting at $500m and an approximate 20% monthly growth rate. $BCB and $KNK have shown less promising growth rates, with $KNK recently experiencing a steep decline. 🦄 MISCELLANEOUS RETHINKING THE FLATCOIN PROBLEM (5 MINUTE READ) [11] This article debates the necessity of a stablecoin for a robust monetary system, challenging the common belief that market-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could fulfill this role. The author suggests a simplified monetary system, maintaining price stability with optimal interest rates, rather than attempting to create a stablecoin pegged to purchasing power. Establishing a native unit of account with a controlled monetary policy might be more beneficial than launching yet another stablecoin effort.

Let's break it down: Gamification: Duolingo's use of gamification elements like points and streaks has significantly increased user engagement and retention. For their high retention rates, they took inspiration from games like Angry Birds and Clash Royale. Duolingo's retention rate has increased to 55% in recent years, up from 13% in 2012. It also uses a psychology trick, the Zeigarnik effect [https://t.mmtrkr.com/clicks/plain/558531c8-69f6-5a5d-af78-78b33207f7c5/8e480861-ed31-5c65-adb1-d74bfd60bcaa/f52fd568-2c59-5de1-b697-2ec831cadd66?urlChildId=d9dc5b40-e16f-5987-aee5-5c11a7d423fa&templateId=4a15859f-4092-43af-bb7d-6286fccf6df9], which says people better remember and finish tasks they've started but haven't finished yet. Using AI: Duolingo Max, now powered by GPT-4, brings AI to language learning! It offers 'Explain My Answer' for insights into your responses and ‘Roleplay’ to practice conversations with app characters, like ordering coffee in a Parisian café. Initially for Spanish and French learners on iOS, it's a fun, immersive way to learn languages. Duolingo also uses AI models, like the Birdbrain model [https://t.mmtrkr.com/clicks/plain/558531c8-69f6-5a5d-af78-78b33207f7c5/8e480861-ed31-5c65-adb1-d74bfd60bcaa/26c89358-a755-5726-98d4-b7c3fab44107?urlChildId=02ce4f17-d49a-58f9-8d72-cf9b4064444c&templateId=4a15859f-4092-43af-bb7d-6286fccf6df9], to predict how well you might do in exercises and tests, creating lessons that are just right for learning. Data-Driven Decisions and Effective Push Notifications: Duolingo always tries new things and checks how users like them. They use what they learn to make the app better. For instance, changing their app icon to a green owl led to 9.6% more downloads. Also, they use their owl mascot, Duo, to send clever reminders.

"Subject: Zuck Blames the System. Body: December 1, 2023 Read in Browser https://thedailyupside.cmail20.com/t/t-e-vdriuky-jjlusjdiy-jj/ Good morning. Thank you for not smoking. And thanks, too, for gambling away your paycheck! New Jersey lawmakers, casino workers, and anti-smoking groups are looking to ban lighting up in casinos, where tray-carrying cigarette girls once roamed freely. Smoking indoors is a thing of the past for much of the US, but some states still allow it in casinos. Sure, there are non-smoking areas, but employees say it's nearly impossible to not be exposed to second-hand smoke. Addictions — especially gambling and smoking — tend to play off each other, so while many Garden Staters support the ban, casino operators are worried it will hurt profits. State Senator Joe Vitale told The Wall Street Journal the current draft of the bill has enough votes to be enacted by the Senate. This time at least, the house might not win.

In the latest chapter of an ongoing legal fight between Zuckerberg’s empire and the Federal Trade Commission, Meta filed a lawsuit against the agency arguing its in-house trials are unconstitutional. Add it to the growing list of corporations pushing back on the legitimacy of US regulatory bodies. A Few Good Metas Way back in 2020, the FTC and then-Facebook agreed to a $5 billion settlement following an investigation into the social platform’s laissez-faire approach to protecting user privacy. The FTC effectively reopened the case this past May, arguing that Meta repeatedly violated guarantees it had made in the agreement, and proposed a handful of new privacy restrictions, including a blanket ban on monetizing user data derived from minors. (The 2020 agreement itself came after the FTC found that Facebook had violated privacy policies from a previous agreement with the agency in 2012). On Monday, a US district judge ruled the FTC could move forward with its push to revise the 2020 agreement. In response, Meta filed a lawsuit late Wednesday with a Washington federal court to halt the FTC’s proceedings, arguing that the agency is operating as “prosecutor, judge, and jury in the same case” because of its in-house court system that violates the company’s right to due process. It’s similar to arguments already being made by other corporations: • Earlier this year, gene-sequencing biotech giant Illumina scored a fast-track appeal of an FTC order to unwind its $7 billion acquisition of cancer detection startup Grail. Some see the case, currently being heard in the 5th Circuit Court, potentially going all the way to the Supreme Court — which could ultimately rule to blunt the FTC’s authority. • On Wednesday, Elon Musk and Mark Cuban-backed hedge-fund manager George Jarkesy testified in front of the Supreme Court arguing that the Security Exchange Commission’s reliance on in-house courts with no peer jury is also unconstitutional — an adverse ruling for the SEC could also ultimately blunt its authority. Antibluster: Of course, where some see a bold stance against federal overreach, others see the type of anti-antitrust bluster typical of massive corporations. “Meta’s lawsuit is a baseless attack on the FTC’s authority, granted to it by Congress,” Katherine Van Dyck, senior counsel at the anti-monopoly nonprofit the American Economic Liberties Project, wrote in a statement [https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/meta-deploys-a-typical-monopolist-tactic-to-declare-enforcement-and-accountability-unconstitutional/]. “The Commission was established over a century ago to protect consumers from predatory, unfair, and anticompetitive businesses that erode our democracy when left unchecked.” - Brian Boyle Please do not delete this text.

Prospective homebuyers face limited supply and historically high mortgage rates, plus something they didn’t see coming: homeowners association (HOA) fees. In a recent The Big Take podcast, Bloomberg [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-30/hoa-fees-and-fines-can-worsen-housing-affordability-crisis?srnd=economics-v2] reported that 80% of new homes for sale are in neighborhoods with HOAs. How Do You Live? HOAs and similar systems are often found in condominiums and enclosed neighborhoods, but roughly one-quarter of the country lives in some kind of HOA-style setup. The goal is to maintain a clean and cohesive look that keeps property values up. But for a long time, even in some cases today [https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-hoa-texas-homes-dallas-renters/], the result perpetuated racial, ethnic, religious, and income segregation. HOA residents make regular payments on top of their mortgages to cover costs for shared spaces or other community assets like landscaping, trash removal, tennis courts, and more. Payments can range from a few hundred dollars a month to more than $1,000, as well as possible fines for not following the upkeep rules. For those shopping for a new home, the fees and fines can be overwhelming: • One resident told Bloomberg that her HOA fined her for a litany of arguably petty violations like oil stains in her driveway, a dying tree on the property, and garage doors that weren’t the same color. When combined with late and legal fees, the resident eventually owed the HOA more than $6,000. When she couldn’t pay that, the HOA sold her house. • About 20 states give HOAs “super-lien” priority, meaning the HOA can claim ownership of a property, even outranking a bank, if residents don’t pay up, Bloomberg reported. Some state and local governments are beginning to regulate HOAs, but there’s not much federal oversight. Back to ‘80s: The US housing market is the least affordable it's been in roughly four decades. The average sale price of homes in the US was $513,400 in this year’s third quarter, a near 60% jump [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ASPUS] from a decade ago. As a result, pending home sales have dropped to record lows, even worse than during the Great Recession, according to the National Association of Realtors [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/pending-home-sales-drop-to-record-low.html]. However, Zillow just predicted a little more breathing room in the new year, with more homes hitting the market, slowing price growth. Plus, by the second half of 2024, the Fed might be in the position to start slashing rates. We’re all crossing our fingers. - Griffin Kelly Please do not delete this text.

On Thursday, UBS published its Billionaire Ambitions Report [https://www.ubs.com/global/en/family-office-uhnw/reports/billionaire-ambitions-client-report-2023.html], and for the first time in the report’s nine-year history, newly minted billionaires got more of their money from inheritance than, well, making money. The bank said this shows that the dragon-like hoards of wealth held by Baby Boomer billionaires are starting to work their way down the generations [https://www.thedailyupside.com/economics/personal-finance/the-family-business-succession-puzzle/]. Boomer Billionaire Babies UBS’ report dovetails with the idea of the “Great Wealth Transfer.” The New York Times reported in May that US family wealth has tripled in real terms since 1989 and that the Baby Boomer generation (people born between 1946 and 1964) holds 50% of that wealth. Not everyone is convinced that the collective Boomer pot o’ gold will trickle down to their descendants: finance writer Ann C. Logue argued [https://www.businessinsider.com/boomer-wealth-transfer-myth-dont-count-on-inheritance-estate-planning-2023-10] that accumulated wealth for most Boomers will get eaten away by healthcare, housing, and end-of-life care costs. For the billionaire class, though, there should be a few shekels to spare after sorting out a nice care home. According to UBS, a total of 137 new billionaires sprang onto this scene this year. The majority of those are what UBS terms “self-made,” i.e. they didn’t inherit their billions. However, in terms of total wealth and average net worth, the inheritance billies had the edge: • The amassed wealth of new inheritance billionaires added up to $150.8 billion, whereas self-made billionaires locked in at a mere $140.7 billion. • The average wealth of an individual dynastic billionaire was $2.8 billion, while a self-made billionaire had an average vault worth just $1.7 billion. A Flash in The Gold-Plated Pan? To be totally fair to this new cohort, it hasn’t been the easiest year for wealth generation. High-interest rates and general economic wibbly-wobbliness haven’t made super fertile ground for entrepreneurship. Nonetheless, UBS sees the emergence of multi-generational billionaires as a long-term trend. ""That’s a theme we expect to see more of over the next 20 to 30 years, as more than 1,000 billionaires pass an estimated $5.2tn to their children,” Benjamin Cavalli, UBS’ head of global wealth management strategic clients said in the report. - Isobel Asher Hamilton Please do not delete this text.

Here’s why: * Weiss said that Intuit delivered ""solid"" earnings results ""in the face of a wall of investor worry,"" with ""3% revenue upside and a 25% EPS beat."" * The company's long-standing reluctance to raise FY targets after Q1 ""gives fodder to the bears,"" the analyst acknowledged, but, conversely, Morgan Stanley ""came away from the report more convicted than ever in EPS upside through FY 2024.""

Here’s why: * Azek Co's quarterly print beat on both revenue and margins, Hughes said, summing up after reviewing the company's most recent earnings report. * Azek is still ""one of the few Building Product names that is growing,"" the analyst told investors. * The analyst noted that Truist Securities maintains its ""buy on any weakness on the guidance"" recommendation.

Reborn’s stock price has doubled since last week, and its trading volume on Thursday was nearly four times its 30-day average. 🥶 NOT: It’s been a while since GameStop Corp.

The stock gained more than 20% on Wednesday, only to turn around and lose 10.5% on Thursday. GameStop investors are used to volatility, but it’s harder to stomach after the epic down year the stock has had in 2023. GameStop has lost 22% YTD. 🔥 HOT: Cancer drug developer Curis (NASDAQ: CRIS ( https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nasdaq/cris?utm_campaign=%5BDaily%5D+12%2F01&utm_content=Daily+12%2F01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer.io )) has been on a tear since it reported its third-quarter earnings almost one month ago. With its 15.9% jump on Thursday, the company has gained 215% since November 2.

Will Airline Stocks Follow? ****************************************************** Despite a sometimes rough economy with high inflation and elevated interest rates, Americans are traveling in large numbers. On Sunday, U.S. air travel hit an all-time record: * According to the TSA, 2,907,378 people were screened at U.S. airports * American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL ( https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nasdaq/aal?utm_campaign=%5BDaily%5D+12%2F01&utm_content=Daily+12%2F01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer.io )) flew nearly 6.5 million passengers over the holiday, with a record 6,100 departures on Sunday alone. * United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL ( https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nasdaq/ual?utm_campaign=%5BDaily%5D+12%2F01&utm_content=Daily+12%2F01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer.io )) flew a new high of 3.2 million customers between November 17 and 23. Does record-breaking travel mean airline stocks could be enjoying a lucrative tailwind? Let’s take a closer look at AAL and UAL. American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) ( http://www.wallstreetzen.com/go/tradingview-pro?source=Daily&aff_sub=2023-12-01&sub4=%7Bcustomer.cio_id%7D&utm_campaign=%5BDaily%5D+12%2F01&utm_content=Daily+12%2F01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer.io )Pros * American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL ( https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nasdaq/aal?utm_campaign=%5BDaily%5D+12%2F01&utm_content=Daily+12%2F01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer.io )) is undervalued by 6.55% relative to our estimated Fair Value price of $13.02 (using discounted cash flow modeling). * AAL’s share price is 4.91x earnings, substantially lower than the US airline industry average of 34.26x. * Over the past year, AAL’s profit margin has risen 6.6 percentage points from -3.6% to 3.0%. Cons * The airline's earnings (EBIT) of $4.26 billion cannot safely cover interest payments on its $41.21 billion in debt. * AAL’s short-term liabilities of $24.38 exceeds its $16.71 billion in short-term assets. * AAL’s revenues are forecast to grow 3.1% annually, less than half the US airline industry's expected growth rate (7.43%). * The 11 analysts we track have mixed feelings about AAL. None rate it a Strong Buy, 3 rate it a Buy, 6 rate it a Hold, 1 rates it a Sell, and 1 rates it a Strong Sell. The bottom line: Despite impressive holiday travel numbers, American Airlines operates in a harsh industry renowned for tight margins. While their current share price may offer an attractive discount, the fundamentals don’t seem to impress analysts, who collectively rank AAL a Hold. (Click here to explore AAL forecasts.

Based on Benjamin Graham’s formula, UAL is trading below its intrinsic value of $70.33. * UAL's share price is 4.45x earnings, compared to 34.26x for the broader US airline industry. * United’s profit margin has jumped 7.3 percentage points over the past 12 months, growing from -1.8% to 5.5%. * UAL’s earnings have grown faster (1.73% annually) than the industry average of -31.72%. * UAL’s revenue has expanded by 5.45% annually, far better than the 0.99% industry average. Cons * UAL's short-term liabilities ($24.76B) exceed its short-term assets ($21.91B). * UAL is expected to see revenues climb 4.42% per year, less than the broader US Airlines industry average of 7.43%. The bottom line: While UAL operates in the same competitive industry as AAL, its metrics appear healthier. Analysts agree. Of the 14 analysts we follow covering UAL, the average rating is a ‘Strong Buy,’ implying they view it as an attractive stock in a notoriously challenging industry.

But the results weren’t necessarily equal across the board. Want to skip straight to the good stuff? Keep reading for some of our favorite Black Friday winners. Recap According to Adobe Analytics, U.S. consumers spent a record $9.8 billion this Black Friday — a 7.5% leap above last year. Despite the seemingly impressive growth, analysts say the overall results were mixed. Michael Lasser, an analyst with UBS (NYSE: UBS ( https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nyse/ubs?utm_campaign=%5BDaily%5D+12%2F01&utm_content=Daily+12%2F01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer.io )), told clients on Monday that “initial reads suggest the season has been lackluster so far.” He continued, “While it’s early, we think it’s best to have muted expectations for the rest of the holiday. This period is likely to include ups and downs.” Who’s Winning? Some of the biggest winners this year are retailers with a value bent. Amid a consumer base frustrated with accelerating prices, it’s no surprise that lower-cose goods might pull in bigger numbers. However, even some more luxurious names saw a surge in revenue. As a result, we picked a favorite name from each group. Black Friday Winner #1: Walmart (NYSE: WMT) ( https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nyse/wmt?utm_campaign=%5BDaily%5D+12%2F01&utm_content=Daily+12%2F01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer.io )* Walmart (NYSE: WMT ( https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nyse/wmt?utm_campaign=%5BDaily%5D+12%2F01&utm_content=Daily+12%2F01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer.io )) enjoys a Zen Score of 46, above the industry average of 38. * After announcing a cautious outlook during their latest earnings release, shares slipped 6% and have yet to recover. However, this may present an opportunistic discount. Aside from a cautious outlook, Walmart's earnings were actually better than expected. * According to KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Bradley Thomas, Walmart witnessed strong Black Friday traffic last week. * Financials look good. WMT’s earnings (EBIT) of $22.44 billion can easily cover interest payments on their $64.80 billion debt obligation, and WMT’s short-term assets of $82.03 billion exceed its long-term liability of $70.57 billion. * 23 of the 27 analysts we follow covering WMT rank it a ‘Buy’ (10) or ‘Strong Buy’ (13). Black Friday Winner #2: Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ: LULU) ( https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nasdaq/lulu?utm_campaign=%5BDaily%5D+12%2F01&utm_content=Daily+12%2F01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer.io )* With a Zen Score of 59, Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU ( https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nasdaq/lulu?utm_campaign=%5BDaily%5D+12%2F01&utm_content=Daily+12%2F01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer.io )) is miles ahead of its industry average score of 35. * Analysts are impressed by strong Black Friday sales despite limited discounts: Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane noted LULU enjoyed “stronger than average” traffic over the weekend. * Financials look good: LULU’s earnings (EBIT) of $1.57 billion can easily cover its interest obligations on its $1.19 billion debt, and the athleisurewear company’s operating cash flow ($1.63 billion) is enough to cover its debt payments. * LULU is expected to generate a higher return on assets (28.92%) than the apparel retail industry average (6.46%). * Of the analysts we follow that cover LULU, 11 consider it a Strong Buy, 6 rate it a Buy, and 2 rate it a Hold. (No Sell or Strong Sell ratings.) In Summary… Walmart and Lululemon just had a great Black Friday. * Despite a recent dip in share price, Walmart demonstrated resilience with strong Black Friday traffic and robust financials. * For their part, Lululemon, distinguished by its high Zen Score, enjoyed significant customer interest and possesses a healthy financial position. Both companies, representing different retail market segments, have garnered positive ratings from most analysts, underlining their strong performance amidst a challenging economic landscape. 👉👉 Click here to research WMT ( https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nyse/wmt?utm_campaign=%5BDaily%5D+12%2F01&utm_content=Daily+12%2F01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer.io ) 👉👉 Click here to research LULU ( https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nasdaq/lulu?utm_campaign=%5BDaily%5D+12%2F01&utm_content=Daily+12%2F01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer.io ) ****************** That’s a Wrap… ****************** There’s a lot going on in the world.
